### Technical Details:
* Pupr allows for people to create accounts that they can use to upload photos of their pets and animals. A user is not required to specify an album when uploading a photo. If the user decides to afterwards, however, they are also able to. After an image URL is provided, the page should refresh with the photo now rendered on the page. Upon clicking on an album, the user can expect the photos that are not in that album to be filtered.
